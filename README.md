# Model Data from Paper

This repository contains the model data used in some papers.
You can also get the model data from their home pages or from the github.

### Tip:
**If you don't need all the model data, it is not recommended to download or clone this repository.** There are some solutions for you:
- Google Chrome plugin: `GitZip for github`. You can download a folder or file through it.
- You can also easily find the same data file from their home pages or github pages listed in corresponding directory.
